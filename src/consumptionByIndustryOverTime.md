# Consumption By Industry Over Time 💸📈

<!-- Load and transform the data -->

<p>Industry-wide consumption has grown steadily across multiple sectors, reflecting the broad expansion of economic activity over the modern era. As global markets and household incomes have increased, industries ranging from grocery and pharmaceuticals to petroleum and construction materials have experienced sustained growth in demand. This rise in consumption is influenced by expanding product availability, targeted marketing, and evolving consumer expectations, resulting in spending patterns that often accelerate faster than population growth or broader economic indicators.</p>

<p> The visualizations in this dashboard highlight these trends, showing how different industries contribute to overall consumption growth and which sectors have seen the most rapid increases over time. By focusing on these patterns, we can better understand how consumption is distributed across the economy, the structural drivers behind rising demand, and the long-term implications for industry planning, market dynamics, and resource allocation.</p>

<h1>Visualization: Consumption, Wealth, and Income Trends</h1>
<p>The dashboard displays three key visualizations designed to show long term patterns in consumer spending, wealth accumulation, and industry level sales. Together, these visualizations demonstrate how consumption has risen steadily, and in some cases exponentially, over the past several decades.</p>

## Real Consumption Expenditure for the U.S.1947–2000

<p>The first visualization illustrates the long-term trends in Real Consumption Expenditures and Household Wealth in the United States from approximately 1950 to 2000. The data reveals a clear divergence between the growth of consumption and the growth of wealth over the second half of the 20th century.</p>

<br>
<h2>Key Observations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Wealth grows from roughly $4,000 billion in 1950 to nearly $40,000 billion by 2000.</b> <br>
This represents a nearly tenfold increase, with the most dramatic acceleration occurring after 1985. By the late 1990s, wealth reaches a peak of about $39,000 billion, reflecting asset booms in housing, stock markets, and financial investments.
  </li>
  <li><b>Real consumption grows much more gradually, rising from about $1,400 billion in 1950 to around $6,000 billion in 2000.</b><br>
  While this growth is steady, it lacks the sharp upward trajectory seen in wealth.
</li>
<li><b>The gap between wealth and consumption widens dramatically over time.</b><br>
In 1950, households held roughly 3 times more wealth than consumption spending. By 2000, this ratio exceeds 6:1.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The visualization shows that wealth accumulation has far outpaced consumption growth. This reflects structural shifts in the U.S. economy including increases in asset values, financialization, and investment-driven income. These aspects expand the capacity for consumption faster than income. Overconsumption becomes easier to sustain when wealth grows rapidly, contributing to higher purchasing power and increased economic inequality. This is seen very clearly as Real Consumption vs Real Disposable Income remain much more close in terms compared to the dramatic difference between wealth and consumption.</p>

## Monthly Wholesale Trade: Sales

<p>The third and fourth visualization presents monthly U.S. industry-level sales across dozens of sectors from 2012 to 2025 by month. This stacked bar chart captures the trends and consistency of customer consumption across industries.</p>
<p>The first graph shows consumption in more industry heavy categories such as lumber, metals etc. The second graph shows consumption in categories the everyday consumer is more likely to shop in, such as grocery or apparel.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that consumption is measured in units sold, not money spent.</p>

</li><br>
<li><b>Steep Drop in 2020:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Industry and Non Industry consumption went down in 2020 likely due to the COVID pandemic.</li>
    <li>It seems like in industry categories consumption continued at a similar pace, in non-industry categories after COVID, consumption seems to be increasing at a higher rate.</li>
  </ul>
</li><br>
<li><b>Several categories consistently contribute large portions of sales, such as:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Petroleum & Petroleum Products</li>
    <li>Drugs and Druggist Sundries</li>
    <li>Grocery & Related Products</li>
    <li>Professional & Commercial Equipment</li>

</li><br>
<li><b>Cateogires with noticeable upward trends include:</b><br>
  <ul>

    <li>Petroleum & Petroleum Products (Increase from 36,303 to 53,819) (148% increase) </li>
    <li>Grocery & Related Products (Increase from 35,140 to 76,716) (218% increase)</li>
    <li>Lumber & Other Construction Materials (Increase from 8,606 to 12,773) (148% increase)</li>
  </ul>
</li><br>
<li><b>Some categories that experience minor decrease included Paper & Paper Products (25% decrease), Metal & Minerals (13% decrease)</b></li>
</ul>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This visualization shows that rising consumption is a pervasive feature of the modern economy. Spending has grown steadily across both industry and non-industry categories, with personal and household consumption increasing at an even faster pace. This indicates that overconsumption is not limited to specific sectors but is embedded in everyday life, reflecting broader cultural and economic forces.</p> <p>Some sectors, such as <b>Grocery & Related Products</b> and <b>Drugs and Druggist Sundries</b>, have seen particularly rapid growth, while others like <b>Paper & Paper Products</b> have declined. The persistence of high-volume categories, including <b>Petroleum & Petroleum Products</b> and <b>Professional & Commercial Equipment</b>, suggests that certain goods consistently drive consumption, reinforcing structural patterns in spending.</p> <p>Even temporary disruptions, such as the 2020 decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, did not alter the overall upward trend. Non-industry spending rebounded faster than industry spending, highlighting the resilience and accelerating nature of personal consumption. Overall, these patterns demonstrate that overconsumption is a structural, long-term feature of the economy, driven by expanding product availability, targeted marketing, and cultural expectations of frequent purchasing.</p><!-- https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/personal-income-and-outlays-august-2025

## Design Rationale

<br>

### Line Charts: Consumption, Wealth, and Income

<p>The first two visualizations both use line charts to show how behavior evolves over time. Time is a continuous variable, making line charts the most effective way to highlight long-term structural changes.</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed breakdown of the two line charts used.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Real Consumption vs. Wealth</b><br>
This chart was designed with dual axes to emphasize the magnitude difference between wealth accumulation and consumption growth. The steep upward curvature of wealth immediately signals accelerating financial inequality and increasing purchasing power among wealth-holding households.
</li>
<li><b>Real Consumption vs. Real Disposable Income</b><br>
This line chart shows proportional growth, indicating how consumption is fundamentally tied to available household resources. Displaying both lines on equal scales helps make the relationship clear and visually interpretable.</li>
</ol>
<br>

### Stacked Bar Chart: Monthly Industry Sales

<p>The monthly stacked bar chart shows the broad scope and consistency of consumption across sectors. This format helps users quickly identify which industries dominate consumer spending, compare seasonal fluctuations in purchasing behavior, and see gradual increases in overall consumption volume year over year</p>
<p>Color coding is used to differentiate industries, allowing viewers to explore general trends in consumer behavior while maintaining clarity across dozens of categories.</p>
<br>

### Software Used: Tableau

<p>We wanted to use a software that would allow us to explore a lot of variables in a way which was both aesthetically appealing and allowed interactive elements. Tableau was the clear choice for this as Observable framework was good for smaller datasets with less variables, and ArgisOnline is better suited for visualizing geographic data.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Tableau's interactive features allow users to explore specific periods, industries, or relationships between variables, making it well-suited for analyzing complex topics like overconsumption.</p>

## Connecting Overconsumption to Broader Social and Economic Impacts

<p>Overconsumption is not just a personal habit but a structural outcome of modern economic systems. As shown in the visualizations, rising wealth and disposable income have normalized continuous purchasing, creating economic and cultural expectations that encourage consumers to buy more over time. This steady growth in consumption reinforces a cycle in which higher demand drives even greater production and spending.</p>

<p>
Economically, this pattern places pressure on global supply chains to produce goods quickly and cheaply, often relying on low-wage labor and resource-intensive manufacturing. These dynamics contribute to labor inequalities, unstable working conditions, and environmental costs embedded in the production process. At the same time, households in high-consumption societies frequently take on more debt to sustain these spending patterns, increasing financial vulnerability.</p>
<p>
Socially, overconsumption widens the divide between those who can participate fully in consumer culture and those who cannot. While affluent groups drive the majority of consumption, its negative impacts—such as pollution, waste, and environmental degradation—are concentrated in low-income and marginalized communities. These communities often experience the greatest exposure to industrial byproducts and climate-related risks tied to the production of consumer goods.
</p>
<p>
Environmentally, the impacts are far-reaching. High consumption levels accelerate resource extraction, increase carbon emissions, and intensify pressure on ecosystems already nearing their limits. These environmental stresses, in turn, reinforce existing social inequities, demonstrating how overconsumption sits at the intersection of economic growth, social inequality, and ecological decline.</p>

<p>
Together, these patterns show that overconsumption is a systemic issue with consequences extending well beyond individual choices. Addressing it requires rethinking production, reducing waste, and adopting more sustainable economic models that balance consumer behavior with social and environmental wellbeing.</p>
