# Consumption By Industry Over Time 💸📈

<!-- Load and transform the data -->

<p>Overconsumption has become one of the defining economic and environmental issues of the modern era. As global wealth increases and consumer markets expand, households are purchasing goods and services at unprecedented levels. This rapid rise in consumption is closely tied to increases in disposable income, credit availability, and shifting cultural norms that emphasize frequent purchasing and rapid product turnover. As a result, consumption patterns have outpaced both population growth and long-term economic fundamentals, highlighting how deeply consumption is embedded in contemporary lifestyles.</p>

<p> The visualizations in this dashboard illustrate the accelerated growth of consumer spending over time and how this growth is intertwined with rising wealth and income. By examining these relationships, we aim to highlight how overconsumption has become a structural feature of the modern economy — one with significant social, economic, and environmental implications.</p>

<h1>Visualization: Consumption, Wealth, and Income Trends</h1>
<p>The dashboard displays three key visualizations designed to show long term patterns in consumer spending, wealth accumulation, and industry level sales. Together, these visualizations demonstrate how consumption has risen steadily, and in some cases exponentially, over the past several decades.</p>

## Real Consumption Expenditure for the U.S.1947–2000
<p>The first visualization illustrates the long-term trends in Real Consumption Expenditures and Household Wealth in the United States from approximately 1950 to 2000. The data reveals a clear divergence between the growth of consumption and the growth of wealth over the second half of the 20th century.</p>

<br>
<h2>Key Observations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Wealth grows from roughly $4,000 billion in 1950 to nearly $40,000 billion by 2000.</b> <br>
This represents a nearly tenfold increase, with the most dramatic acceleration occurring after 1985. By the late 1990s, wealth reaches a peak of about $39,000 billion, reflecting asset booms in housing, stock markets, and financial investments.
  </li>
  <li><b>Real consumption grows much more gradually, rising from about $1,400 billion in 1950 to around $6,000 billion in 2000.</b><br>
  While this growth is steady, it lacks the sharp upward trajectory seen in wealth.
</li>
<li><b>The gap between wealth and consumption widens dramatically over time.</b><br>
In 1950, households held roughly 3 times more wealth than consumption spending. By 2000, this ratio exceeds 6:1.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The visualization shows that wealth accumulation has far outpaced consumption growth. This reflects structural shifts in the U.S. economy—including increases in asset values, financialization, and investment-driven income—that expand the capacity for consumption even faster than income. Overconsumption becomes easier to sustain when wealth grows rapidly, contributing to higher purchasing power and increased economic inequality.</p>

## Monthly Wholesale Trade: Sales
<p>The third visualization presents monthly U.S. industry-level sales across dozens of sectors from 2012 to 2014. This stacked bar chart captures the breadth and consistency of consumer spending across industries.</p>
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1763932169482' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Monthly Sales by Industry Over Time ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;In&#47;IndustrySales_17639205197950&#47;MonthlySalesbyIndustryOverTime&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='IndustrySales_17639205197950&#47;MonthlySalesbyIndustryOverTime' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;In&#47;IndustrySales_17639205197950&#47;MonthlySalesbyIndustryOverTime&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763932169482');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
<br>
<h2>Key Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Total monthly sales consistently range from $400,000 million to $450,000 million (i.e., $400B–$450B).</b><br>
This stability indicates a strong baseline of consumer purchasing across all sectors.
</li>
<li><b>Sales gradually increase:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>In early 2012, total monthly sales average around $405B.</li>
    <li>By late 2014, monthly totals rise to roughly $450B, indicating an increase of about $45B over two years.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Several categories consistently contribute large portions of sales, such as:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Petroleum & Petroleum Products</li>
    <li>Motor Vehicles & Motor Parts</li>
    <li>Grocery & Related Products</li>
    <li>Professional & Commercial Equipment</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Industries with noticeable upward trends include:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Chemicals & Allied Products</li>
    <li>Apparel</li>
    <li>Grocery & Related Products</li>
    <li>Hardware & Plumbing Supplies</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Seasonal patterns emerge, such as retail increases around October–December, reflecting holiday consumption spikes.</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This visualization highlights the breadth of overconsumption across the entire economy. The sustained high monthly spending—around half a trillion dollars per month—shows that overconsumption is not confined to specific industries but is deeply embedded in many sectors simultaneously.</p>
<p>The steadily rising totals from 2012 to 2014 suggest that even short-term economic periods exhibit consistent upward pressure on consumption, reflecting:
<ul>
<li>Expanding product variety</li>
<li>Increased marketing and consumer targeting</li>
<li>Shortening product life cycles</li>
<li>Growing cultural norms around frequent purchasing</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Together, these patterns demonstrate the structural nature of overconsumption in the modern economy.</p>

## Design Rationale
<br>

### Line Charts: Consumption, Wealth, and Income
<p>The first two visualizations both use line charts to show how behavior evolves over time. Time is a continuous variable, making line charts the most effective way to highlight long-term structural changes.</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed breakdown of the two line charts used.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Real Consumption vs. Wealth</b><br>
This chart was designed with dual axes to emphasize the magnitude difference between wealth accumulation and consumption growth. The steep upward curvature of wealth immediately signals accelerating financial inequality and increasing purchasing power among wealth-holding households.
</li>
<li><b>Real Consumption vs. Real Disposable Income</b><br>
This line chart shows proportional growth, indicating how consumption is fundamentally tied to available household resources. Displaying both lines on equal scales helps make the relationship clear and visually interpretable.</li>
</ol>
<br>

### Stacked Bar Chart: Monthly Industry Sales
<p>The monthly stacked bar chart shows the broad scope and consistency of consumption across sectors. This format helps users quickly identify which industries dominate consumer spending, compare seasonal fluctuations in purchasing behavior, and see gradual increases in overall consumption volume year over year</p>
<p>Color coding is used to differentiate industries, allowing viewers to explore general trends in consumer behavior while maintaining clarity across dozens of categories.</p>
<br>

### Software Used: Tableau
<p>We wanted to use a software that would allow us to explore a lot of variables in a way which was both aesthetically appealing and allowed interactive elements. Tableau was the clear choice for this as Observable framework was good for smaller datasets with less variables, and ArgisOnline is better suited for visualizing geographic data.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Tableau's interactive features allow users to explore specific periods, industries, or relationships between variables, making it well-suited for analyzing complex topics like overconsumption.</p>

-------------------------

## Connecting Overconsumption to Broader Social and Economic Impacts

<p>Overconsumption is not just a personal habit but a structural outcome of modern economic systems. As shown in the visualizations, rising wealth and disposable income have normalized continuous purchasing, creating economic and cultural expectations that encourage consumers to buy more over time. This steady growth in consumption reinforces a cycle in which higher demand drives even greater production and spending.</p>

<p>
Economically, this pattern places pressure on global supply chains to produce goods quickly and cheaply, often relying on low-wage labor and resource-intensive manufacturing. These dynamics contribute to labor inequalities, unstable working conditions, and environmental costs embedded in the production process. At the same time, households in high-consumption societies frequently take on more debt to sustain these spending patterns, increasing financial vulnerability.</p>
<p>
Socially, overconsumption widens the divide between those who can participate fully in consumer culture and those who cannot. While affluent groups drive the majority of consumption, its negative impacts—such as pollution, waste, and environmental degradation—are concentrated in low-income and marginalized communities. These communities often experience the greatest exposure to industrial byproducts and climate-related risks tied to the production of consumer goods.
</p>
<p>
Environmentally, the impacts are far-reaching. High consumption levels accelerate resource extraction, increase carbon emissions, and intensify pressure on ecosystems already nearing their limits. These environmental stresses, in turn, reinforce existing social inequities, demonstrating how overconsumption sits at the intersection of economic growth, social inequality, and ecological decline.</p>

<p>
Together, these patterns show that overconsumption is a systemic issue with consequences extending well beyond individual choices. Addressing it requires rethinking production, reducing waste, and adopting more sustainable economic models that balance consumer behavior with social and environmental wellbeing.</p>
